  "description": "The ocean component of CNRM-ESM2-1 (Séférian et al. 2019) is based on the version 3.6 of NEMO (Nucleus for European Models of the Ocean ; Madec, 2016). At the surface, the model uses the split-explicit non-linear free surface formulation proposed by Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), with a variable volume. Seawater thermodynamics uses the equation of state defined in the Thermodynamic Equation of State 2010 (TEOS-10, IOC et al., 2010), with conservative temperature and absolute salinity being then the prognostic variables. \n    Radiative transfer in the water column is resolved using a chlorophyll-dependent three-waveband scheme as described in Lengaigne et al. (2007) and Séférian et al. (2019).\n    Lateral diffusivity and viscosity are parameterized as in NOCS-ORCA1 (Danabasoglu et al., 2014). Parameterization of vertical mixing is also similar, with two notable exceptions in CNRM-CM6-1: mixing induced by breaking internal waves is parameterized following de Lavergne et al. (2016) and the Fox-Kemper et al. (2011)  submesoscale mixed layer restratification scheme is activated.",
