        # Top Level Model Documentation
        
        This template documents your complete climate model as required for CMIP7 participation and is mandatory for publishing datasets to ESGF. The documentation enables model discovery and comparison across institutions, provides essential context for interpreting model output, and supports automated validation workflows that ensure data quality and scientific reproducibility in the global climate research community.
