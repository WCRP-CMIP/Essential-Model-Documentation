    "name": "**Model name becomes CMIP7 source_id**\n\n**Format:**\n- Include family name (recommended): 'HadGEM3-GC31-HH', 'CESM2'\n- Include version: 'CNRM-ESM2-1', 'UKESM1-0-LL'\n- Use hyphens for separators\n- Use consistent capitalization\n\n**This name will be used:**\n- As @id in EMD\n- As source_id in CMIP7 file metadata\n- In directory structures\n- In data citations\n\n**Choose carefully** - changing later requires re-registration!",
    "family": "**Model family:**\n\nModels in a family share substantial code but differ in:\n- Resolution (e.g., -LL, -MM, -HH suffixes)\n- Component selection\n- Parameter tuning\n- Configuration\n\n**Examples:**\n- Family: 'HadGEM3' → Models: 'HadGEM3-GC31-LL', 'HadGEM3-GC31-MM', 'HadGEM3-GC31-HH'\n- Family: 'CESM' → Models: 'CESM2', 'CESM2-WACCM', 'CESM2-FV2'\n- Family: 'CNRM-CM' → Models: 'CNRM-CM6-1', 'CNRM-ESM2-1'\n\n**Must be registered first** via Model Family issue.\n\n**Leave as 'Not applicable' if:**\n- First model (no family yet)\n- Standalone model",
    "description": "**Must cover ALL three component categories:**\n\n**1. Dynamic components** (brief overview):\n'Includes atmosphere (ARPEGE-Climat v6.3) with 91 levels extending to 80km, ocean (NEMO v3.6) with ORCA1 grid, and land surface (SURFEX v8) with multi-layer soil and vegetation.'\n\n**2. Prescribed components** (explain treatment):\n'Atmospheric ozone is prescribed from monthly mean climatology. Sea surface temperatures are prescribed for AMIP experiments.'\n\n**3. Omitted components** (note absence):\n'Land ice is omitted - no interactive ice sheets.'\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Be concise - detailed descriptions are in component registrations\n- Mention all component types from the CV\n- Explain why prescribed/omitted\n- 2-4 paragraphs typical",
    "dynamic_components": "**Components that are actively simulated in the model.**\n\n**Each dynamic component you select here:**\n- Must have a registered Model Component\n- Must have a component_config ID to list below\n- Will appear in your model's output\n\n**Common configurations:**\n- **Minimal**: atmosphere, ocean, land-surface (3)\n- **Standard**: + sea-ice, land-ice (5)\n- **Earth System**: + atmospheric-chemistry, aerosol, ocean-biogeochemistry (8)\n\n**Select all that are dynamically simulated** in your model.",
    "prescribed_components": "**Components represented by input data** (not simulated).\n\n**Examples:**\n- Prescribed SSTs for atmosphere-only runs\n- Prescribed ozone for models without chemistry\n- Prescribed sea ice for ocean-only models\n\n**These components:**\n- Are NOT registered as Model Components\n- Use input data (constant or time-varying)\n- Don't require component_config IDs\n\n**Leave empty if all components are either dynamic or omitted.**",
    "omitted_components": "**Components completely absent from the model.**\n\n**Examples:**\n- No atmospheric chemistry (simplified models)\n- No land ice (no ice sheets)\n- No ocean biogeochemistry (physical ocean only)\n\n**These components:**\n- Are NOT registered\n- Have no representation in model\n- Should be mentioned in description as omitted\n\n**Leave empty if all components are either dynamic or prescribed.**",
    "component_configs": "**Enter component_config IDs, one per line:**\n\n**Format:** {domain}_{component_id}_{h_grid}_{v_grid}\n\n**Example:**\n```\natmosphere_arpege-climat-version-6-3_c100_v100\nland-surface_surfex-v8-modeling-platform_c100_v102\nocean_nemo-v3-6_c101_v103\naerosol_tactic_c100_v100\natmospheric-chemistry_reprobus-c-v2-0_c100_v100\nsea-ice_gelato_c101_v104\nocean-biogeochemistry_piscesv2-gas_c101_v103\n```\n\n**You received these IDs** when you submitted Model Component issues.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Must list exactly one config per dynamic component\n- All configs must already exist\n- Order doesn't matter\n\n**Validation:** System will check configs exist and match your dynamic_components list.",
    "embedded_components": "**Define which components run inside others.**\n\n**Format:** One pair per line as `embedded,host`\n\n**Example:**\n```\naerosol,atmosphere\natmospheric-chemistry,atmosphere\nsea-ice,ocean\nocean-biogeochemistry,ocean\n```\n\n**Rules:**\n- Use component TYPES (not component IDs)\n- Embedded component must be in dynamic_components\n- Host component must be in dynamic_components\n- Embedded components CANNOT be in coupling_groups\n- Can have nested embedding (A in B, B in C)\n- NO cycles (A in B, B in C, C in A = invalid)\n\n**Common patterns:**\n- Aerosol/chemistry embedded in atmosphere\n- Sea ice/biogeochemistry embedded in ocean\n\n**Leave empty if:** No embedded components (all are coupled)",
    "coupling_groups": "**Define groups of mutually coupled components.**\n\n**Format:** One group per line, components comma-separated\n\n**Example 1 - Fully coupled (3-way):**\n```\natmosphere,land-surface,ocean\n```\nAll 3 exchange data directly.\n\n**Example 2 - Multiple groups:**\n```\natmosphere,ocean\nland-surface,land-ice\n```\nTwo separate coupling groups.\n\n**Example 3 - 4-way coupling:**\n```\natmosphere,land-surface,ocean,land-ice\n```\nAll 4 coupled together.\n\n**Rules:**\n- Use component TYPES (not IDs)\n- Only SUPERIOR HOST components (NOT embedded ones)\n- Components in a group ALL couple with each other\n- All coupled components must be connected (directly or indirectly)\n\n**Superior hosts** = components NOT listed as 'embedded' in embedded_components.\n\n**Validation:** System checks no embedded components in coupling groups!",
    "calendar": "**Calendar types define which dates are valid in your model.**\n\n**Most common:**\n- **standard** (gregorian): Standard calendar with leap years (most common)\n- **365_day** (noleap): Fixed 365 days, no leap years (paleo simulations)\n- **360_day**: 12 months × 30 days (idealized)\n\n**List in order of use:**\n- Put most commonly used first\n- Example: If 'standard' for historical/future and '365_day' for paleo, list both with 'standard' first\n\n**For CMIP7:**\n- Only include calendars you'll actually use in CMIP7 experiments\n- Don't list all possible calendars your model *could* use",
    "release_year": "**When was this model first used?**\n\nAcceptable:\n- Year of first publication using this model\n- Year model version was released\n- Year simulations began\n\n**Examples:**\n- CNRM-ESM2-1: 2018 (Séférian et al. 2019 paper)\n- UKESM1-0-LL: 2019 (Sellar et al. 2019 paper)\n\n**Not:**\n- Year of institution founding\n- Year of first model in family\n\n**Must be** between 1950 and current year.",
    "reference_dois": "**Model-level publications only:**\n\nProvide DOI URLs for papers describing:\n- The complete model as a whole\n- Model overview and design\n- Multi-component integration\n\n**DO NOT include:**\n- Component-specific papers (those go in Model Component issues)\n- Papers using the model for science\n- Technical reports without DOIs\n\n**Format:**\n```\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001791\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001683\n```\n\n**One DOI per line, no other text.**\n\n**Typically 1-3 references** for model overview papers."
