    "name": "**Model name becomes CMIP7 source_id**\n\nThe name may include an indication of the top-level model's family and should also specify a particular version of the top-level model.\n\n**Guidelines from EMD specification:**\n- Include family name (recommended)\n- Include version identifier\n- Use hyphens for separators\n- Use consistent capitalization\n\n**This name will be used:**\n- As @id in EMD\n- As source_id in CMIP7 file metadata\n- In directory structures\n- In data citations\n\n**Choose carefully** - changing later requires re-registration!",
    "family": "**Model family** (from EMD specification):\n\nA family of models share much of their code bases, but may be configured in different ways (e.g. different resolutions, parameter choices, or the inclusion or not of particular model components).\n\nA family name often persists across model versions and may be the first part of its full name.\n\nSee Masson and Knutti (2011) for an example of how the family can be used to inform model genealogies.\n\n**Must be registered first** via Model Family issue.\n\n**Leave as 'Not applicable' if:**\n- First model (no family yet)\n- Standalone model\n- There is no such family for the top-level model",
    "description": "**From EMD specification - must cover ALL component categories:**\n\nThe description should include a brief mention of all components, whether dynamically simulated, prescribed, or omitted.\n\n**1. Dynamic components** (brief overview):\nDynamically simulated components are described elsewhere in component registrations, so only a very short, high-level overview is required. Include the component's name if appropriate.\n\n**2. Prescribed components** (explain treatment):\nPrescribed components are not described elsewhere, so information on how they are treated should be included. These are typically represented by constant or time varying values or fields that are provided as input to the model.\n\n**3. Omitted components** (note absence):\nComponents that are wholly omitted must be noted as such.\n\n**2-4 paragraphs typical**",
    "dynamic_components": "**Components that are dynamically simulated** (from EMD specification):\n\nThese components must be further described by the model_components registrations. There must be at least one dynamically simulated model component.\n\n**Component types defined by EMD:**\n- **aerosol**: Behaviour and evolution of aerosols suspended in the atmosphere\n- **atmosphere**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the atmosphere\n- **atmospheric-chemistry**: Behaviour and evolution of the chemical composition of the atmosphere\n- **land-ice**: Frozen freshwater in glaciers, ice-caps, ice-sheets, and ice-shelves\n- **land-surface**: Water, energy, and mass fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere\n- **ocean**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the ocean\n- **ocean-biogeochemistry**: Biological, geological, and chemical processes in the ocean\n- **sea-ice**: Frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface\n\n**Each dynamic component you select:**\n- Must have a registered Model Component\n- Must have a component_config ID listed below",
    "prescribed_components": "**Components represented with prescribed values** (from EMD specification):\n\nThese components are typically represented by constant or time varying values or fields that are provided as input to the top-level model.\n\n**Include in model description how they are treated, for instance:**\n'The model requires that a monthly mean, zonally averaged ozone field be prescribed because the model does not include an interactive atmospheric chemistry component.'\n\n**These components:**\n- Are NOT registered as Model Components\n- Use input data (constant or time-varying)\n- Don't require component_config IDs\n\n**Leave empty if all components are either dynamic or omitted.**",
    "omitted_components": "**Components wholly omitted** (from EMD specification):\n\nComponents that are wholly omitted from the top-level model.\n\n**Include in model description, for instance:**\n'The model has no treatment of atmospheric chemistry.'\n\n**These components:**\n- Are NOT registered\n- Have no representation in model\n- Should be mentioned in description as omitted\n\n**Leave empty if all components are either dynamic or prescribed.**",
    "component_configs": "**Component configuration IDs** (one per line):\n\nYou received these IDs when you submitted Model Component issues.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Must list exactly one config per dynamic component\n- All configs must already exist\n- Order doesn't matter\n\n**Validation:** System will check configs exist and match your dynamic_components list.",
    "embedded_components": "**Embedded and host component pairs** (from EMD specification):\n\nEach ordered pair of an embedded component followed by its host component comprises two of the model components listed by the dynamic_components.\n\n**An embedded model component typically:**\n- Shares the same horizontal grid as the host component\n- Is coded such that within a single time-step, interactions between it and its host might involve exchanges of information affecting both\n- Cannot be easily 'driven' independently of its host (cannot run in stand-alone 'offline' mode)\n- May not have a recognisable name or version number (other than those of the host component)\n- Is constructed such that the code would be exceedingly difficult to extract and transfer to another top-level model\n\n**Rules:**\n- Embedded component has a single host component\n- Multiple components can be embedded in the same host\n- Host can itself be embedded in another host (nested hierarchy)\n- Superior host components are those NOT embedded in any other\n- NO cycles allowed (A in B, B in C, C in A = invalid)\n- Embedded components CANNOT be coupled with any other components\n\n**Format:** One pair per line as `embedded,host`",
    "coupling_groups": "**Coupled component groups** (from EMD specification):\n\n**A coupled model component typically:**\n- Is identified using a recognisable name, and often a version number (e.g. 'MOM5', the fifth version of the Modular Ocean Model)\n- Relies on a variable calculated by another component or calculates a variable relied on by another component\n- Interacts at regular intervals with other components by exchanging quantities needed by each to advance a simulation (such as fluxes of mass, momentum, energy, etc.)\n- The shared quantities may pass through a coupler or be conveyed by other means\n- Is coded such that it is relatively isolated from other parts of a top-level model code and might be extracted to be adopted in another top-level model\n\n**Rules:**\n- Only SUPERIOR HOST components (NOT embedded ones) can be coupled\n- A superior host must be coupled with at least one other superior host (unless there are no others)\n- Components in a group ALL couple with each other\n- All coupled components must be directly or indirectly coupled with all other coupled components\n\n**Format:** One group per line, components comma-separated",
    "calendar": "**Calendar types** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe calendar(s) that define which dates are permitted in the top-level model.\n\n**Options (from calendar CV):**\n- **standard**: Gregorian–Julian calendar (most common)\n- **proleptic_gregorian**: Gregorian leap-year rule extended before 1582-10-15\n- **julian**: Julian rule for leap years\n- **365_day**: No leap years, all years 365 days (paleo simulations)\n- **366_day**: Every year is a leap year, all years 366 days\n- **360_day**: All years 360 days, 12 months × 30 days (idealized)\n- **utc**: Gregorian calendar with leap seconds (UTC)\n- **tai**: Gregorian without leap seconds (International Atomic Time)\n- **none**: No calendar\n\n**For CMIP7:**\nOnly the set of calendars adopted in CMIP7 simulations should be provided, identifying which calendar is most commonly used by listing it first. For instance, if 'standard' applies for historical and future simulations and '365_day' for paleo-experiments, then list both with 'standard' first.",
    "release_year": "**Release year** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe year in which the top-level model being documented was released or first used for published simulations.\n\n**Acceptable:**\n- Year of first publication using this model\n- Year model version was released\n- Year simulations began\n\n**Not:**\n- Year of institution founding\n- Year of first model in family\n\n**Must be** between 1950 and current year.",
    "reference_dois": "**Model-level publications** (from EMD specification):\n\nOne or more references to published work describing the top-level model as a whole.\n\n**Provide DOI URLs for papers describing:**\n- The complete model as a whole\n- Model overview and design\n- Multi-component integration\n\n**DO NOT include:**\n- Component-specific papers (those go in Model Component issues)\n- Papers using the model for science\n- Technical reports without DOIs\n\n**One DOI per line, no other text.**\n\n**Typically 1-3 references** for model overview papers."
