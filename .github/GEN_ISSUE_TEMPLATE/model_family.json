    "name": "**Family name** (from EMD specification):\n\nA family of models share much of their code bases, but may be configured in different ways (e.g. different resolutions, parameter choices, or the inclusion or not of particular model components).\n\nA family name often persists across model versions and may be the first part of the model's full name.\n\nSee Masson and Knutti (2011) for an example of how the family can be used to inform model genealogies.\n\n**Naming conventions:**\n- Often first part of model names\n- Use hyphens for separators\n- Typically institution/project acronym + model name\n\n**Used for:**\n- Model genealogy studies\n- Identifying related models\n- Tracking code lineage",
    "description": "**Family description** (from EMD specification):\n\nDescribe what characterizes this model family.\n\n**What to include:**\n1. **Origin**: Institution and development history\n2. **Scientific focus**: What distinguishes this family\n3. **Common features**: Shared code, physics, or approach\n4. **Variation dimensions**: How family members differ (resolution, parameters, components)\n\n**2-3 paragraphs typical**",
    "scientific_domains": "**Scientific domains** (from EMD component CV):\n\nSelect all scientific domains covered by ANY member of this family.\n\n**Component types:**\n- **aerosol**: Behaviour and evolution of aerosols suspended in the atmosphere\n- **atmosphere**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the atmosphere\n- **atmospheric-chemistry**: Behaviour and evolution of the chemical composition of the atmosphere\n- **land-ice**: Frozen freshwater in glaciers, ice-caps, ice-sheets, and ice-shelves\n- **land-surface**: Water, energy, and mass fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere\n- **ocean**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the ocean\n- **ocean-biogeochemistry**: Biological, geological, and chemical processes in the ocean\n- **sea-ice**: Frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface\n\n**Note:** Individual models in the family may cover a subset of these domains.",
    "representative_member": "**Representative member:**\n\nA well-known or canonical member of the family.\n\n**Useful for:**\n- Quick reference to understand family characteristics\n- Finding documentation\n- Citation purposes\n\n**Can be:**\n- Most recent version\n- Most widely used version\n- Reference configuration\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- First model in family\n- No clear representative yet",
    "website": "**Official website:**\n\nURL with family documentation.\n\n**Ideal content:**\n- Model family overview\n- Technical documentation\n- Publication list\n- Code access information\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- No dedicated website\n- Information scattered across papers",
    "reference_dois": "**Family-level publications:**\n\nKey publications about the model family as a whole.\n\n**Include:**\n- Family overview papers\n- Model genealogy studies (e.g., Masson and Knutti 2011)\n- Foundational technical papers\n\n**DO NOT include:**\n- Model-specific papers (those go in Model issues)\n- Component-specific papers (those go in Model Component issues)\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- New family with no publications yet\n- Will add later"
