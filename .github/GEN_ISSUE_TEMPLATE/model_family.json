    "name": "**Family names are persistent identifiers across model versions.**\n\n**Examples:**\n- 'HadGEM3' - family for HadGEM3-GC31-LL, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, HadGEM3-GC31-HH\n- 'CESM' - family for CESM1, CESM2, CESM2-WACCM\n- 'CNRM-CM' - family for CNRM-CM5, CNRM-CM6-1, CNRM-ESM2-1\n- 'ACCESS' - family for ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5\n\n**Naming conventions:**\n- Often first part of model names\n- Use hyphens for separators\n- Typically institution/project acronym + model name\n\n**Used for:**\n- Model genealogy studies (Knutti et al.)\n- Identifying related models\n- Tracking code lineage",
    "description": "**What to include:**\n\n1. **Origin**: Institution and development history\n2. **Scientific focus**: What distinguishes this family\n3. **Common features**: Shared code, physics, or approach\n4. **Variation dimensions**: How family members differ\n\n**Examples:**\n\n'The HadGEM3 family is developed at the UK Met Office Hadley Centre. All members share the Unified Model dynamical core and core physics but differ in resolution, atmospheric top height, and component selection.'\n\n'The CESM family from NCAR represents a hierarchy of Earth system model configurations sharing CAM atmosphere, POP ocean, and CLM land components, with variations in atmospheric chemistry, carbon cycle, and resolution.'\n\n**2-3 paragraphs typical**",
    "scientific_domains": "**Select all scientific domains covered by ANY member of this family.**\n\n**Note:** Individual models in the family may cover subset.\n\n**Example:**\n- Family covers: atmosphere, ocean, land-surface, land-ice, sea-ice\n- Model A uses: atmosphere, ocean, sea-ice (coupled model)\n- Model B uses: atmosphere, land-surface, land-ice (atmosphere-land model)\n\n**Select the union** of all domains used by family members.",
    "representative_member": "**A well-known or canonical member of the family.**\n\n**Useful for:**\n- Quick reference\n- Understanding family characteristics\n- Finding documentation\n\n**Examples:**\n- HadGEM3 family → 'HadGEM3-GC31-LL'\n- CESM family → 'CESM2'\n- CNRM-CM family → 'CNRM-CM6-1'\n\n**Can be:**\n- Most recent version\n- Most widely used version\n- Reference configuration\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- First model in family\n- No clear representative",
    "website": "**Official website with family documentation.**\n\n**Ideal content:**\n- Model family overview\n- Technical documentation\n- Publication list\n- Code access information\n\n**Examples:**\n- https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model\n- https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/\n- https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/cmip6/\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- No dedicated website\n- Information scattered across papers",
    "reference_dois": "**Key publications about the model family:**\n\n**Include:**\n- Family overview papers\n- Model genealogy studies\n- Foundational technical papers\n\n**Examples:**\n```\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001739  (Family overview)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1029/2011GL046864  (Genealogy paper)\n```\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- New family with no publications yet\n- Will add later\n\n**Note:** Model-specific papers go in Model issues, not here."
