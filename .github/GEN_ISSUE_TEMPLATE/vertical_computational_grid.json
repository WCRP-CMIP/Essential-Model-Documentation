    "description": "**Grid description** (from EMD specification):\n\nA description is only required if there is information that is not covered by any of the other properties.\n\nSome model components may have different and wholly independent vertical grids for different physical processes (e.g., a land surface model with soil, lake and snow sub-models). In such cases it may not be possible to provide some properties because a single value might not apply to all processes. When this happens, use the description property to record the relevant information for each physical process.\n\n**Include:**\n- Number of levels\n- Coordinate type\n- Vertical extent\n- Purpose (atmosphere, ocean, soil, ice)\n- Any non-standard features\n\n**Omit when:** All info covered by other properties",
    "vertical_coordinate": "**Vertical coordinate types** (from EMD vertical_coordinate CV):\n\nThe coordinate type of the vertical grid.\n\n**Atmosphere options:**\n- **atmosphere_hybrid_height_coordinate**: Terrain-following near surface, flat at top (common)\n- **atmosphere_hybrid_sigma_pressure_coordinate**: Sigma near surface, pressure at top\n- **atmosphere_sigma_coordinate**: Pure terrain-following sigma\n- **height**: Height above reference surface\n\n**Ocean options:**\n- **depth**: Standard z-levels from surface (most common)\n- **ocean_s_coordinate**: Stretched vertical (high resolution near surface)\n- **ocean_sigma_z_coordinate**: Hybrid sigma-z coordinate\n- **ocean_sigma_coordinate**: Pure sigma (terrain-following)\n\n**Land/Ice options:**\n- **depth**: Soil layers below surface\n- **land_ice_sigma_coordinate**: Ice sheet layers\n- **height**: Above ground height\n\n**Omit if:** Different physical processes have grids with different vertical coordinate types (note this in description instead)",
    "n_z": "**Number of layers** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe number of layers (mass points) in the vertical grid.\n\n**Typical values:**\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n- Low-top models: 30-50 levels (~30km)\n- Mid-top models: 50-80 levels (~50-60km)\n- High-top models: 80-150 levels (~80-150km)\n\n**Ocean:**\n- Standard: 40-50 levels (~5000m)\n- High-resolution: 60-75 levels\n\n**Land/Ice:**\n- Soil: 3-15 layers\n- Ice sheets: 5-20 layers\n\n**Leave blank if:**\n- Varies across domain\n- Adaptive mesh\n- Different for different processes",
    "top_layer_thickness": "**Top layer thickness** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe thickness of the uppermost layer, in metres.\n\n**Typical values:**\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n- Near surface: 10-50m\n- At model top: 500-2000m (increases with height)\n\n**Ocean:**\n- Surface layer: 1-10m\n\n**Land surface:**\n- Top soil layer: 0.01-0.1m\n\n**Ice:**\n- Top layer: 0.04m (from BISICLES example)\n\n**Provide representative value if varies.**\n\n**Note:** For atmosphere, this typically refers to the layer nearest the surface. For ocean, this is the surface layer.",

    "total_thickness": "**Total vertical extent** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe total thickness of all layers combined, in metres.\n\n**Typical values:**\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n- Low-top: ~30,000m (30km)\n- Mid-top: ~50,000-61,000m (50-61km)\n- High-top: ~80,000-150,000m (80-150km)\n- Example: 84763.34m (from EMD)\n\n**Ocean:**\n- Standard: ~4,000-6,000m\n- Deep ocean: up to 11,000m\n\n**Ice sheets:**\n- Greenland: up to 3,000m\n- Antarctica: up to 4,500m\n\n**Soil:**\n- Typically 3-10m depth"
