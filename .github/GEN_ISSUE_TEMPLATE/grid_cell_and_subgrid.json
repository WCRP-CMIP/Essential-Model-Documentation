    "grid_type": "**Cell distribution pattern**\n\nDefines how grid cells are arranged across the domain.\n\n- **regular-latitude-longitude**: Uniform spacing in lat/lon\n- **reduced-gaussian**: Fewer points near poles (spectral models)\n- **tripolar**: North Pole singularity moved onto land (ocean models)\n- **displaced-pole**: Single rotated pole\n- **icosahedral**: Quasi-uniform spherical coverage\n- **cubed-sphere**: Six cube faces projected onto sphere\n- **adaptive-mesh**: Dynamically refined regions\n\nSee [CF Conventions grid mappings](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html#appendix-grid-mappings) for details.",
    "grid_mapping": "**Coordinate reference system**\n\nDefines how cell positions are located.\n\n- **latitude-longitude**: Standard geographic coordinates\n- **rotated-latitude-longitude**: Pole moved to reduce distortion over region of interest\n- **stereographic**: Polar projection (polar regions)\n- **lambert-conformal**: Mid-latitude regional projection",
    "region": "**Geographic coverage**\n\n- **global**: Full Earth coverage\n- **regional**: Limited area domain\n- **arctic/antarctic**: Polar-focused domains\n- **tropical**: Equatorial band\n\nSelect multiple if the grid covers distinct regions.",
