    "arrangement": "**Grid arrangement/staggering** (from EMD arrangement CV):\n\nA grid arrangement describes the relative locations of computed mass-related and velocity-related quantities on the horizontal computational grid.\n\nWhen the computational grid relies on more than one subgrid, it is referred to as a 'staggered' grid. For most staggered grids, the velocity-related variables are calculated on a subgrid offset from the mass-related variables.\n\n**Options:**\n- **arakawa_a**: Mass- and velocity-related quantities at the same location on each grid cell (unstaggered)\n- **arakawa_b**: Velocity-related quantities at the corners of mass cells\n- **arakawa_c**: Velocity-related quantities at the centres of mass cell edges, perpendicular to edge (most common for atmosphere/ocean)\n- **arakawa_d**: Velocity-related quantities at the centres of mass cell edges, tangential to edge\n- **arakawa_e**: Mass-related quantities at the centres of velocity cell edges\n\n**Match arrangement to number of subgrids:**\n- Arakawa-A (unstaggered): 1 subgrid\n- Arakawa-B: 2 subgrids (mass + velocity at corners)\n- Arakawa-C: 2-3 subgrids (mass + x_velocity + y_velocity, or mass + velocity for unstructured)\n- Complex staggering: 2+ subgrids",

Often the locations of mass-related and velocity-related variables differ, so more than one horizontal subgrid will be defined.\n\n**Format:** One subgrid ID per line\n\nYou received these IDs when you submitted your Grid Cells and Subgrid issue(s).\n\n**Number of subgrids must match your arrangement:**\n- Unstaggered/Arakawa-A: 1 subgrid (mass only)\n- Arakawa-B: 2 subgrids (mass + velocity)\n- Arakawa-C: 2-3 subgrids (mass + velocity components)\n\n**Order matters** for some arrangements (convention: mass subgrid first, then velocity)"
