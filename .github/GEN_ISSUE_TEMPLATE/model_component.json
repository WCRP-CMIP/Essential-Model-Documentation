    "component": "**Component types** (from EMD component CV):\n\nA component type describes a set of interactive processes that are simulated by a single model component.\n\n- **aerosol**: The behaviour and evolution of aerosols suspended in the atmosphere\n- **atmosphere**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the atmosphere\n- **atmospheric-chemistry**: The behaviour and evolution of the chemical composition of the atmosphere\n- **land-ice**: Frozen freshwater in glaciers, ice-caps, ice-sheets, and ice-shelves\n- **land-surface**: Water, energy, and mass fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere\n- **ocean**: Dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical processes in the ocean\n- **ocean-biogeochemistry**: Biological, geological, and chemical processes in the ocean\n- **sea-ice**: Frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface\n\n**Note:** EMD component types are similar to CMIP 'realms' but the context differs. An EMD component type defines processes simulated by one model component; CMIP realms are assigned to output variables according to which processes the variable is physically related to.",
    "name": "**Component naming** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe name of the model component.\n\n**If component has common name:**\n- Use official name with version\n\n**If embedded with no commonly recognised name:**\n- Construct a name by combining the host component's name with this component's type, separated by a hyphen\n\n**Consistency:**\n- Use consistent capitalization\n- Include version numbers\n- Match official documentation",
    "family": "**Component family** (from EMD specification):\n\nFor a component, its family members should all share much of their code bases, but the members may be configured in different ways (e.g. different resolutions, parameter choices, or the inclusion or not of particular physical processes).\n\nSee Masson and Knutti (2011) for an example of how the family can be used to inform model genealogies.\n\n**Leave as 'Not applicable' if:**\n- First/only version of component\n- No family grouping exists\n- There is no such family for the model component",
    "description": "**Scientific overview** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe description should summarise the key processes simulated by the model component.\n\n**What to include:**\n1. **Component purpose**: What processes does it simulate?\n2. **Key physics**: Main parameterizations or physics packages\n3. **Scope**: Domain and processes covered\n4. **Version info**: What's new or distinctive about this version\n\n**Keep it high-level** - detailed physics goes in publications (provide DOIs below).",
    "horizontal_computational_grid": "**Horizontal computational grid** (from EMD specification):\n\nA description of the model component's horizontal computational grid, i.e. the grid on which the component is integrated.\n\n**Grid ID format:** c### (e.g., c100, c101)\n\nYou received this ID when you submitted your Horizontal Computational Grid issue.\n\n**Omit if:**\n- The model component has no horizontal computational grid\n- Component has no horizontal dimension (e.g., 1D column models)\n- Will register grid later\n\n**Check existing grids:** Browse https://emd.mipcvs.dev/horizontal_computational_grid/",
    "vertical_computational_grid": "**Vertical computational grid** (from EMD specification):\n\nA description of the model component's computational vertical grid, i.e. the grid on which the component is integrated.\n\n**Grid ID format:** v### (e.g., v100, v103)\n\nYou received this ID when you submitted your Vertical Computational Grid issue.\n\n**Omit if:**\n- The model component has no vertical computational grid\n- Component has no vertical dimension (e.g., 2D surface models)\n- Will register grid later\n\n**Check existing grids:** Browse https://emd.mipcvs.dev/vertical_computational_grid/",
    "code_base": "**Code base location** (from EMD specification):\n\nThe location of the source code for the model component. The location must be a fully qualified URL, and could be a unique persistent identifier (DOI).\n\nIf the code base is in a version control repository (such as a git repository) then the URL should identify a specific point in the repository's history.\n\n**Preferred formats:**\n- **GitHub/GitLab URL** pointing to specific tag/commit\n- **DOI** if available (e.g., Zenodo archive)\n\n**If not public:**\n- Enter 'private'\n\n**Omit if:**\n- The source code is not available",
    "reference_dois": "**Component references** (from EMD specification):\n\nOne or more references to published work for the model component.\n\n**Find DOIs for:**\n- Model/component description papers\n- Component-specific publications\n- Technical documentation with DOI\n\n**Format requirements:**\n- Must start with 'https://doi.org/'\n- One per line\n- No other text\n\n**At least one required** - this helps users understand your component!"
