### What is the EMD and why we need it

The **Essential Model Documentation (EMD)** provides a standardised, high-level description of earth system models. It bridges the gap between model developers and data users by capturing key configuration information without imposing excessive documentation burdens.

Model output is only useful if users understand how it was produced. But comprehensive documentation is time-consuming, and inconsistent formats make comparison difficult. EMD solves this by defining a minimal but sufficient set of metadata covering the top-level model and its components (atmosphere, ocean, land surface, etc.), including what's dynamically simulated, prescribed, or omitted.

For CMIP7, EMD is mandatory for model registration—ensuring every participating model has consistent, comparable documentation from day one.
