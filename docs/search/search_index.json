It is intended to contain information about model configuration that may be helpful to the communities who expect to make use of the model output, whilst not imposing burdensome requirements on those providing the data. It is not intended to contain all information about a model. More detailed model documentation than that provided by the EMD should be found in the references cited as part of the EMD, or from other external sources. The EMD has been designed to be applicable to any earth system model. It was originally developed for use within the CMIP7 project ( Dunne et al., 2025 ), for which EMD registration is a mandatory requirement for model participation. A model cannot be assigned a CMIP7 source_id unless its EMD has been provided and accepted. The EMD is defined by a versioned specification document maintained by the CMIP7 MIP Controlled Vocabularies Task Team . Structure \u00b6 The EMD is collected for the model as a whole (the top-level model), and for each of the model's dynamically simulated components. A top-level model is described by its name, model family, calendar, release year, references to published work, and the classification of its components as dynamically simulated, prescribed, or omitted. For CMIP7, the model name is registered as the source_id . A model component describes an individual part of the top-level model that dynamically simulates a set of physical processes. Eight component types are defined: aerosol, atmosphere, atmospheric chemistry, land surface, land ice, ocean, ocean biogeochemistry, and sea ice. Each dynamic component is described by its name, family, scientific overview, references, code location, and its relationships with other components. A computational grid describes the mesh on which a model component is integrated. The horizontal grid records the staggering arrangement, grid type, resolution, region, and coordinate reference system. The vertical grid records the coordinate type, number of layers, and layer thicknesses. Component relationships \u00b6 All dynamically simulated components within a top-level model interact with each other either directly or indirectly. The EMD identifies which components directly interact, characterising each as either \"embedded in\" or \"coupled with\" other components. An embedded component is tightly integrated within a host component, typically sharing its grid and code base. An embedded component has a single host, which may itself be embedded in another host, forming a hierarchy. An embedded component cannot also be coupled with any other components. A coupled component exchanges quantities with other components at regular intervals, such as fluxes of mass, energy, and momentum. Coupling is symmetrical: if component A is coupled with component B, then B is also coupled with A. Only superior host components \u2014 those at the top of an embedding hierarchy \u2014 may be coupled with each other. flowchart TD ATM[\"Atmosphere\"] CHEM[\"Atmos.

It explains how submissions reach you, what has already been checked, what needs your judgement, and how to record your decision. Overview \u00b6 EMD entries are submitted through online forms. Before a submission reaches you it passes through automated validation. Your role is to assess the scientific content that machines cannot judge \u2014 whether the description is accurate, the component classifications are sensible, and the entry is not a duplicate. How submissions reach you \u00b6 Step 1: Submission \u00b6 A modelling group fills in a structured form on GitHub. No programming or Git knowledge is needed. flowchart LR A([\"Modelling group\\ncompletes form\"]) --> B[\"Submission created\\nwith structured fields\"] style A fill:#f0f4f8,stroke:#90b4d6,color:#1e293b style B fill:#fafafa,stroke:#b0bec5,color:#1e293b Step 2: Automated validation \u00b6 The submission is checked against the EMD schema. If anything is missing or incorrectly formatted, the submitter is asked to correct it. Only valid submissions proceed further. flowchart LR B[\"Submission\"] --> C{\"Automated\\nvalidation\"} C -->|Pass| D[\"Submission\\nqueued for review\"] C -->|Fail| E[\"Sent back to\\nsubmitter with\\nspecific errors\"] style C fill:#f3edf5,stroke:#b39dba,color:#1e293b style D fill:#eef5ee,stroke:#8cb88c,color:#1e293b style E fill:#faf0f0,stroke:#d19a9a,color:#1e293b style B fill:#fafafa,stroke:#b0bec5,color:#1e293b Step 3: Review assignment \u00b6 A reviewer is selected based on scientific domain, independence from the submitting group, and current workload. The reviewer (you) is notified via the pull request. flowchart LR D[\"Valid submission\"] --> F{\"Reviewer\\nassigned\"} F --> G([\"You receive\\nthe review request\"]) style D fill:#fafafa,stroke:#b0bec5,color:#1e293b style F fill:#f3edf5,stroke:#b39dba,color:#1e293b style G fill:#f0f4f8,stroke:#90b4d6,color:#1e293b Step 4: Your decision \u00b6 You review the flagged items and choose one of three actions: approve, request changes, or reject. flowchart LR G([\"You review\\nthe submission\"]) --> K{\"Decision\"} K -->|Approve| L[\"Entry registered\\nin the EMD\"] K -->|Request changes| N[\"Submitter\\nupdates and\\nresubmits to you\"] K -->|Reject| M[\"Submission closed\\nwith explanation\"] style G fill:#f0f4f8,stroke:#90b4d6,color:#1e293b style K fill:#fdf5eb,stroke:#d4b07a,color:#1e293b style L fill:#eef5ee,stroke:#8cb88c,color:#1e293b style M fill:#faf0f0,stroke:#d19a9a,color:#1e293b style N fill:#fdf5eb,stroke:#d4b07a,color:#1e293b What has already been checked \u00b6 By the time a submission reaches you, the following have been verified automatically. You do not need to re-check these. Check What was tested Required fields All mandatory fields are present and correctly formatted Unique identifier The proposed ID does not clash with any existing entry Cross-references Any referenced grids, families, or components exist in the registry Published references DOI links are valid and reachable Controlled vocabularies Values such as grid types, calendar types, and arrangements match the accepted lists Numeric plausibility Values such as layer counts, resolutions, and release years fall within expected ranges What needs your judgement \u00b6 The review report on the pull request highlights the items below. These require scientific expertise that automated checks cannot provide. Description quality \u2014 Is the scientific description accurate and informative? For models, does it mention all component types (dynamically simulated, prescribed, and omitted)? Would a researcher unfamiliar with this model understand what it does from the description alone? Naming conventions \u2014 Does the name follow the patterns used by other entries of the same type? For models, is the source_id consistent with CMIP naming expectations? Potential duplicates \u2014 A similar entry may have been flagged. Is this genuinely a new entry, or should the submitter be updating an existing one? Component completeness \u2014 For model submissions: do the dynamic, prescribed, and omitted component assignments together account for all the scientific domains expected for this type of model? Is anything missing or misclassified? Scientific plausibility \u2014 Do the values make sense as a whole? For example: a 1 km resolution global ocean grid would be unusual; a land-only model that omits the land surface component would be contradictory; a release year before the model family was established would be inconsistent. Recording your decision \u00b6 Take one of the following actions directly on the pull request. Approve \u2014 Use the GitHub review interface to approve. The entry is registered immediately and appears on the EMD site within minutes. Request changes \u2014 Leave review comments explaining what needs to change. Be specific: name the field, state the problem, and suggest a correction where possible. The submitter is notified and may update the submission, which then returns to you. Reject \u2014 Close the pull request with a written explanation. The submitter may open a new submission after addressing the concerns. Practicalities \u00b6 You were assigned because your expertise matches the submission. You have 14 days to respond before the review is reassigned. If you have a conflict of interest or are unable to review, reassign the pull request to another reviewer via the assignee field. Once you approve and the entry is merged: The entry appears on the EMD website within a few minutes. Other submitters can immediately reference it in their own submissions (for example, selecting a registered grid or model family from a dropdown). For model submissions, the source_id becomes officially registered in the CMIP7 controlled vocabularies.","title":"Reviewer information"},{"location":"Reviewer_information/#overview","text":"EMD entries are submitted through online forms.
