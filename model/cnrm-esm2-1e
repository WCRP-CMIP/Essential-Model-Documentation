  "description": "CNRM-ESM2-1e is the CNRM Earth System model version 2 designed for CMIP6 on the basis of the physical core CNRM-CM6-1 (Voldoire et al. 2019). In concentration mode, it is the same model as CNRM-ESM2-1 (Séférian et al. 2019), it only differs from CNRM-ESM2-1 in emission-driven mode (see Bossert et al. 2026). The main adaptations consist in a better conservation of the carbon in all the components leading to a more consistent/realistic carbon flux evolution in historical simulations.",
