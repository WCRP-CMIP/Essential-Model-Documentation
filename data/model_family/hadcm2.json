    "description": "HadCM2 is an early family of Met Office Hadley Centre coupled climate models that established foundational approaches for UK climate modeling. The family represents atmosphere-ocean coupled models used for climate research and early climate projection studies, serving as predecessors to the more comprehensive HadGEM family of models.",
    "collaborative_institutions": [],
    "common_scientific_basis": "Common scientific approach based on primitive equation atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, consistent flux coupling between atmosphere and ocean components, and shared approaches to representing key climate processes within the computational constraints of early climate modeling.",
    "computational_requirements": "Designed for computing capabilities of the 1990s, typically requiring 10s to 100s of processors for climate simulations, with memory and storage requirements modest by current standards but significant for the era.",

    "established": "1995",
    "evolution": "HadCM2 developed in the mid-1990s as part of early coupled climate modeling efforts, evolved through various configurations and improvements, and served as foundation for subsequent HadCM3 and eventually HadGEM model family development.",
