    "description": "The Community Land Model (CLM) family represents several aspects of the land surface including surface heterogeneity and consists of components or submodels related to land biogeophysics, the hydrologic cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions, and ecosystem dynamics. Spatial land surface heterogeneity is represented as a nested subgrid hierarchy.",

    "common_scientific_basis": "Common scientific approach includes the nested subgrid representation of land surface heterogeneity, independent simulation of biogeophysical processes for each landunit/column/PFT combination, area-weighted averaging for atmosphere-land coupling.",
    "computational_requirements": "Typically embedded within atmospheric models, computational cost scales with subgrid complexity and number of PFTs. Generally represents 10-25% of total coupled model computational cost.",
