  "description": "UniCiCles (Unified Model-CISM-BISICLES) is a package combining BISICLES with an interface that obtains boundary conditions from Unified Model or JULES data, using code derived from the Glint interface of the Glimmer-CISM ISM. BISICLES uses the adaptive-mesh Chombo libraries. All cells in the mesh are rectangles that may be recursively refined by subdivision into four smaller cells with the same aspect ratio. The configuration of BISICLES approximates the momentum equations using the \"shelfy-stream\" approximation with simplified vertical shear strains included in the effective viscosity, often referred to as SSA*. Basal traction is set to zero beneath floating ice and modelled using power laws beneath grounded ice. Greenland ice sheet uses a linear drag law everywhere while AIS uses a cubic law far upstream from the grounding line, which tends to a Coulomb friction law near the grounding line.",
