  "description": "ARPEGE-Climat Version 6.3 is the atmospheric component of the CNRM climate and Earth System models (CNRM-CM6-1 and CNRM-ESM2-1). It is based on the cycle 37 of the ARPEGE/IFS model (declared in 2010), developed under a collaboration between Météo-France and ECMWF. ARPEGE-Climat shares a large part of its physics and dynamics with its NWP counterpart ARPEGE used operationnally at Météo-France. In comparison to ARPEGE-Climat Version 5.1 used for the CMIP5 exercice in CNRM-CM5.1, most of the atmospheric physics has been updated or revisited (Roehrig et al. 2019, Voldoire et al. 2019). For the surface, it is coupled to the SURFEX platform (Decharme et al. 2019).",
