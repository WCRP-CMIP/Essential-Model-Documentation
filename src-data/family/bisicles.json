  "description": "BISICLES (Berkeley Ice Sheet Initiative for CLimate ExtremeS) family uses the adaptive-mesh Chombo libraries for ice sheet modeling. All cells in the mesh are rectangles that may be recursively refined by subdivision into four smaller cells with the same aspect ratio. The configuration approximates the momentum equations using the 'shelfy-stream' approximation with simplified vertical shear strains included in the effective viscosity, often referred to as SSA-. Basal traction is set to zero beneath floating ice and modelled using power laws beneath grounded ice.",
  
  "shared-code-base": "All BISICLES family members use the Chombo adaptive mesh refinement framework with rectangular cells and 4:1 recursive refinement. Common SSA- (shelfy-stream with simplified vertical shear strains) momentum approximation, shared basal traction treatments, and adaptive mesh update algorithms. Written in C++ using Chombo libraries with interfaces for coupling to climate models.",
  
  "common-scientific-basis": "Shared scientific approach includes SSA- approximation for momentum equations, adaptive mesh refinement targeting dynamically active ice regions, basal traction set to zero beneath floating ice with power law treatments beneath grounded ice, and consistent ice thermodynamics treatment across family members.",
  
  "variation-dimensions": "BISICLES family members differ in: Coupling interfaces (standalone vs coupled to climate models), Domain applications (Greenland vs Antarctic ice sheets), Base mesh resolution (1-10 km typical), Refinement strategies and update frequencies, Basal friction law specifics (Greenland uses linear drag law everywhere, Antarctic Ice Sheet uses cubic law far upstream from grounding line transitioning to Coulomb friction law near grounding line), Boundary condition sources and processing.",

  "computational-requirements": "Adaptive mesh allows efficient computational resource usage by concentrating resolution where ice dynamics are most active. Greenland ice sheet modeled with 9.6 km square base cells that may subdivide to 1.2 km, Antarctic ice sheet with 8 km base cells that may subdivide to 2 km. Meshes updated every 8 timesteps for Greenland and 4 for Antarctic allowing resolution to evolve with ice dynamics.",

UniCiCles (Unified Model-CISM-BISICLES) variant combines BISICLES with interface that obtains boundary conditions from Unified Model or JULES data, using code derived from Glint interface of Glimmer-CISM ISM. Coupled with atmosphere, land surface, and ocean components. Uses land-ice-sigma-coordinate vertical grid with 10 levels. Reference from EMD: 'Smith, R.
