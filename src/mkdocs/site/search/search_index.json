These require your scientific judgement \u2014 the pipeline cannot verify them automatically. Flag What to check Description quality Is it scientifically accurate and complete? Does it mention all component types (dynamic, prescribed, omitted) where relevant? Is it specific enough to be useful to a data user? Name conventions Does the name follow the conventions used by other entries of this type? For models, does the source_id format match CMIP expectations? Potential duplicates A similar entry was detected. Is this genuinely new, or should the submitter be modifying an existing entry instead? Component completeness For models: do the dynamic/prescribed/omitted assignments together cover all the expected scientific domains for this model type? Is anything missing or misclassified? Scientific plausibility Do the values make scientific sense together? Examples of things to question: a 1 km global ocean grid, a land-only model with no land surface component, a release year before the model family was established. Your options \u00b6 After reviewing the flagged items and the JSON diff in the PR, take one of the following actions directly on the pull request. Action How Outcome Approve Approve the PR via the GitHub review interface PR is merged immediately; entry enters the registry; docs update automatically within minutes Request changes Leave review comments specifying what needs to change; do not approve Submitter is notified; they update the PR; it returns to you for re-review Reject Close the PR with a written explanation Issue is also closed; submitter may open a new issue after addressing the concerns When requesting changes, be specific \u2014 quote the field name, state what is wrong, and where possible suggest the correction. Vague comments create unnecessary back-and-forth. Reviewer assignment \u00b6 You were assigned because your scientific domain matches the submission type. Assignment also accounts for institutional independence from the submitting group and current reviewer workload. You have 14 days to respond before the submission is escalated to another reviewer.

These require your scientific judgement \u2014 the pipeline cannot verify them automatically. Flag What to check Description quality Is it scientifically accurate and complete? Does it mention all component types (dynamic, prescribed, omitted) where relevant? Is it specific enough to be useful to a data user? Name conventions Does the name follow the conventions used by other entries of this type? For models, does the source_id format match CMIP expectations? Potential duplicates A similar entry was detected. Is this genuinely new, or should the submitter be modifying an existing entry instead? Component completeness For models: do the dynamic/prescribed/omitted assignments together cover all the expected scientific domains for this model type? Is anything missing or misclassified? Scientific plausibility Do the values make scientific sense together? Examples of things to question: a 1 km global ocean grid, a land-only model with no land surface component, a release year before the model family was established.","title":"What is flagged for your review"},{"location":"998_Reviewer_information/#your-options","text":"After reviewing the flagged items and the JSON diff in the PR, take one of the following actions directly on the pull request.
